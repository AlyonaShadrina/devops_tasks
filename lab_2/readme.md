Run `redeploy_apps.sh` to redeploy your frontend and backend apps.

Your folder structure should go like this:
```
|
|-redeploy_apps.sh // script
|-nestjs-rest-api // backend app
|-shop-react-redux-cloudfront // frontend app
```

The code is for redeployment only, it implies, that server setting are already done.
